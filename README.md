# Brewed Awakening

Welcome to the Brewed Awakening website! This is a multipage website for a fictional coffee shop that showcases its offerings and provides a way for customers to get in touch.

## Project Structure

## Design Choices

The design of the "Brewed Awakening" website was inspired by a modern, minimalistic aesthetic that emphasizes the coffee shop's inviting atmosphere. The layout features a clean structure with a prominent navigation bar, ensuring easy access to all pages. The color palette consists of warm browns and creams, reflecting the coffee theme and creating a cozy feel. High-quality images of coffee drinks are used to engage visitors visually and entice them to explore the menu.

## Features Implemented

JavaScript was utilized to enhance user interactivity, particularly in the contact form. I implemented form validation to ensure that users fill out all required fields before submission. This feature provides immediate feedback, improving user experience and preventing incomplete submissions.

## Challenges Faced

During development, one challenge was ensuring the website's responsiveness across various devices. I overcame this by using CSS media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Deployment Process

For deployment, I chose Netlify due to its user-friendly interface. I created a new site on Netlify, linked it to my GitHub repository, and configured the build settings. The site was live within minutes, making it accessible to users worldwide.
